# patentexpiration

I am only leaving in this up here in the interest of being transparent about my learning 
process. It is bad code, don't write Python code like this. When I wrote this, I had not 
yet finished Downey's Think Python and I had some ideas from listening to Talk Python, 
the podcast. There are so many things that I would change.

But anyway, I managed to get it deployed for a short time on pythonanywhere, so it is the 
first time I considered myself a full stack web developer. You enter a patent number, and 
it told you if it was expired or not (kind of).

I wrote it because I saw a presentation for a legal tech startup that wanted to provide 
this service for $40 a pop. I thought it was silly since I could (even then) write the 
MVP for it in a couple of weekends. I more or less did.

I have a bunch of ideas about how to use this use case to illustrate async Python, since 
the patent API is async. One day.
